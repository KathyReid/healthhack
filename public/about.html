<h1>About BRISK</h1>
<p>
Formed as part of <a href="http://healthhackmelb.com/">Health Hack Melbourne 2013</a>, BRISK provides a tool for women to explore their risk for breast cancer. Breast cancer risks fall into two distinct categories;
</p>
<ul>
<li>Modifiable risks: These risks are able to be moderated through changes to lifestyle and behaviour, such as weight. </li>
<li>Non-modifiable risks: These risks are not able to be changed. They are due to genetics and family history.</li>
</ul>
<p>By better understanding their risk for contracting breast cancer, the tool helps women to make informed health decisions, which may include preventative medication and/or surgery.</p>

In doing so, women would be empowered to alter those lifestyle factors which were modifiable - such as weight.</li>
